# An interpretable meta-clustering framework for single-cell RNA-Seq data integration and evaluation


## Introduction

Here we introduce a novel similarity metric based on Inter-group Differential ExpRession (IDER) and propose a workflow of Clustering by IDER (CIDER). The origin version was firstly proposed in our publication (Cancer Cell, 2020), in which we introduced the use of meta-clustering to partition scRNA-seq data from ovarian cancer fallopian tube epithelial cells confounded by structured batch effects and inter-patient variability. In this work, we present a scalable version of this methodology, and demonstrate its generalizable utility for wider application.
